Random DSA work in Rust.

`LEETCODE/NC150` is a straight NeetCode 150 run. Progress is tracked manually in `solved.toml`. If something isn’t marked there, it’s not done.

`LEETCODE/PRACTICE` is just practice. Extra problems, redoing things, interview prep, whatever felt worth writing down.

`CODEFORCES` is an archive of solutions I submitted there. It’s only for reference.

Most files keep one working solution. Other approaches stay commented if they’re useful.
