# DSA (Rust)

Personal workspace for data structures & algorithms practice in Rust.

The repository is intentionally split by purpose.

---

## Structure

### `LEETCODE/NC150`
Canonical NeetCode 150 problems.

- Strictly tracked via `solved.toml`
- Problems are considered solved **only** if explicitly marked
- One source of truth, no inference, no automation
- Focused on correctness, invariants, and production-quality implementations

### `LEETCODE/PRACTICE`
Free-form problem solving.

- Problems outside NC150
- Re-solving known problems for deeper understanding
- Interview-driven exploration
- No progress tracking contract

### `CODEFORCES`
Archive of Codeforces solutions.

- Mirrors online submissions
- Stored for reference and review
- Git history here is not meant to reflect Codeforces activity

---

## Notes

- Rust is used deliberately for low-level clarity and correctness
- Multiple approaches may be documented per problem
- Only one active solution is kept per file
- Build artifacts are ignored at the repo root

This repo is a workspace, not a showcase.
